Ventixe Event Management System 

Frontend application created with React + Vite.
   - Features:
       - Public startpage displaying events and the option to view details and order tickets.
       - Admin portal with options to sign in and sign  (of course not a safe solution because anyone can sign in and start adding events, but MVP, right?)
           - Features:
             - View events, add events
             - View venues, add venues
             - View orders
             - View stats for number of venues, number ofo rders and number of tickets sold
  - Issues (some of the known issues) 
    - Breadcrumb isn't always displaying well formatted names and paths
    - Loading is sometimes very slow
    - There is no way to add pictures to events (I didn't have time to solve the issues with uploading).
    - The purchasing of tickets isn't actually functioning, it's more of a placeholder for a secure payment solution.
